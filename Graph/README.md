# Graph 
* Graph is collections of nodes and edges...

graph = node + edge

### `node` = visual it with some Data... 
### `edge` = any connection between pair of nodes... 

### `node` 
we can also call [node] as [vertex]... So it is just data/things... & it has neighbor nodes... <br/> neighbor node are any node that are accessible through the edge...

### `edge` 
It is just relationship between pair of nodes...

<br/>

## Graph can be:
1. Directed 
2. Undirected
3. Directed + wight
4. Undirected + wight
5. Cycle
6. Acyclic 

<br/>

### 1. Directed graph
It is unidirectional.

<br/>

### 2. Undirected graph 
No arrow head, mean no directionality
