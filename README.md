# DataStructure & Algorithm


## DataStructure
* Stack
* Queue
* LinkList
* Dictionary


## Algorithm
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
    * order agnostic binary-search
    * floor celling value finding 
    * duplicate value counting
    * [Missing Array]
3. Time Complexity

```
DataStructure is a way to store the data,
inside the memory of the computer

there are lots of different methods are available

```
Algorithm is set of instruction, that computer needs to follow
in order to come up with solution
